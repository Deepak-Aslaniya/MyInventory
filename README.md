# MyInventory – Smart Inventory & Logistics Admin App (Figma Prototype)

## Overview
**MyInventory** is a high-performance Inventory Management Admin Mobile App UI Prototype designed in Figma. It is built for business owners who manage stock across multiple locations like warehouses and retail shops. The platform centralizes data from various partners (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) and tracks physical resources like workers and transport vehicles. This design provides a structured foundation for building a production-ready Flutter or React Native application.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create a modern, data-centric UI that simplifies complex logistics. By organizing data into visual charts and clear lists, the prototype demonstrates how an admin can monitor stock levels, worker assignments, and partner performance in real-time. It aims to bridge the gap between messy spreadsheets and a streamlined mobile experience, ready for backend integration.
